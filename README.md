## üìÑ License
**Ethical Approval**
The dataset used in this master thesis, *Kidney Tumor Detection and Segmentation in Computed Tomography Scans using Deep Learning Models*, is based on **kidney CT scans** collected **after approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB)** of **King Abdullah University Hospital (KAUH)**, Jordan. The approval order number is **137-2021**, and the scans were withdrawn from the hospital‚Äôs database for cases of renal masses, as performed by the **CT scan service** in **2021**.
